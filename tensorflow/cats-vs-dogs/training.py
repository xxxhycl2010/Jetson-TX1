#The aim of this project is to use TensorFlow to process our own data.
#    - input_data.py:  read in data and generate batches
#    - model: build the model architecture
#    - training: train

# I used Ubuntu with Python 3.5, TensorFlow 1.0*, other OS should also be good.
# With current settings, 10000 traing steps needed 50 minutes on my laptop.

# data: cats vs. dogs from Kaggle
# Download link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/data
# data size: ~540M

# How to run?
# 1. run the training.py once
# 2. call the run_training() in the console to train the model.

# Note: 
# it is suggested to restart your kenel to train the model multiple times 
#(in order to clear all the variables in the memory)
# Otherwise errors may occur: conv1/weights/biases already exist......
